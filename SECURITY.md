## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

If you notice a vulnerability in FlowOS or any of our created repositories, please contact the development team at: info@favoriteone.dev or by emailing me (favoriteone aka Elias Stinson the lead developer) at favorite@favoriteone.dev. Any reports made to those emails surrounding packages supported, or used by FlowOS will be forwarded to the respective maintainers. Thanks for your concern and time!
